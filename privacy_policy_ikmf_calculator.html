    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
    I do not knowingly collect personally

    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
    me with personal information, I immediately
    delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
    and you are aware that your child has provided us with
    personal information, please contact me so that
    I will be able to do necessary actions.
